BMS Issues

Need soft start on 5V and 3v3 rail DONE
Fix footprint for ltc6802 DONE
add input caps and esd protection everywhere
consider better common-mode amps, or protect the inputs better.
fix glitch on HV outputs.
Consider soft-starts for each output, or just diode-or them on the board and get rid of the discharge circuit. DONE
Need pull-ups on the LTC gpos. DONE
fix SDO resistor values. See simulation. (2k2 and 1k8 are swapped) DONE
consider 5V ldo following the the switching regulator to reduce noise/ripple. ADD a electrolytic cap. DONE
fix leakage from CAN_TX to 3v3 rail DONE
move ground from lower LTC chip DONE
change usb connector to more common one.
